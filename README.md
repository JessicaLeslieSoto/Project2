ITMD 362-Project 2

 Self-Critique:
 For me as an individual, my part I wish I could have made it more organized for the text. For example, make it more attractive for the user, for the user to be like more interactive with the text. But for the CRN it was good because it made much easier for the user to put in the numbers. Compared to the original site where the rows where confusing for me. But overall I learned a lot to make my website more organized in general make it more cleaner.
